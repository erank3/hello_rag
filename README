Running the Hello_Rag Docker Image
 
This guide will help you build and run the Hello_Rag Docker image, and use it to ask questions.
Prerequisites
 
Before you begin, make sure you have Docker installed on your machine.
Configuration
 
The OPENAI_API_KEY is defined in the Dockerfile. Make sure to replace it with your actual OpenAI API key.
Building the Docker Image
 
To build the Docker image, navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and execute the following command:

docker build -t hello_rag .    
 
This command builds the Docker image and tags it with the name hello_rag.
Running the Docker Container
 
Once the Docker image is built, you can run it using the following command:

docker run -p 8000:80 hello_rag  
 
This command runs the Docker container and maps port 80 inside the container to port 8000 on your host machine.
Asking a Question
 
With the Docker container running, you can ask a question by navigating to the following URL in your web browser:

http://localhost:8000/?question="what is the title of the doc?"  
 
Replace "what is the title of the doc?" with your actual question.
